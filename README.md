**California Construction and Infrastructure Projects Scraper**
**Overview**
The California Construction and Infrastructure Project Scraper is a web scraping method developed using Selenium WebDriver with Java to extract data related to construction and infrastructure projects from various cities in California. This project aims to automate the process of collecting project information from different sources and standardizing the data for analysis and reporting purposes.
**Methods Used for Scraping: **
I employed Selenium WebDriver with Java to perform web scraping tasks efficiently. Selenium WebDriver provided robust capabilities to navigate through various web pages and interact with their elements programmatically. Leveraging Java's versatility, I scripted automation routines to seamlessly traverse through the list of URLs provided in Table 1, ensuring comprehensive coverage of construction and infrastructure project data across multiple cities in California. 

Using Selenium WebDriver, I extracted both HTML content and text content from each webpage, enabling a thorough analysis of project details and associated information. This approach allowed for the extraction of structured data elements as well as textual descriptions, enhancing the depth and breadth of the scraped data. 

**Features**
**Automated Data Scraping: **Utilizes Selenium WebDriver to navigate through multiple web pages and extract project data from each source.
**Comprehensive Coverage:** Scans websites of different cities in California to gather information on construction and infrastructure projects.

**Requirements**
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
Selenium WebDriver library
ChromeDriver executable (or WebDriver compatible with your preferred browser)
